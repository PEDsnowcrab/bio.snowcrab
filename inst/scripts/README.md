NOTE to all:

The "current.assessment.year.r" must be changed every year but must be kept separate from "initialize.local.environment" as running in parallel mode requires occasionally overrding some parameters in "p".

Begin in sequence due to data dependencies starting with:
```
 01.snowcrab.r
 02. ...., etc
```
